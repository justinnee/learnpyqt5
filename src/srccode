# Signal & Slot
signal: the message send by object or control
    e.g. the event such as clicking on a button
    As soon as a button is pressed, it will send a message to the outside.
    While the message needs some codes to intercept,which are called slots.
slot: a method or function in fact

signal = event
slot = event function

One signal can be bounded with several slots.
One slot can also intercept several signals.
